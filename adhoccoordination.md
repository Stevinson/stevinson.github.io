# Ad Hoc Coordination Dissertation

This repository includes code for the thesis entitled 'Utilising Policy Types to Achieve Effective Ad Hoc Coordination in the
Game Othello'. It uses Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination to explore multi agent systems, in this case the board game Othello, 
that involve heterogeneous agents that do not know, a priori, how other agents in the system behave. Also included is a copy of the 
finished dissertation report.
