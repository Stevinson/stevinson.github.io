title: Ad Hoc Coordination Dissertation
---

Whilst at the University of Edinburgh I wrote a dissertation entitled 'Utilising Policy Types to Achieve Effective Ad Hoc Coordination in the Game Othello'. It uses Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination to explore multi agent systems, in this case the board game Othello, 
that involve heterogeneous agents that do not know, a priori, how other agents in the system behave.
