title: "Experiments in Creating Social Value: An exploration of the meanwhile use industry"
---

This project is the first academic study of the activities of the meanwhile use industry, and its attempts to use meanwhile leases to turn empty commercial property into a solution to tackle urban decline and increase community output. Qualitative research into the social objectives of the meanwhile use sector was carried out to formulate a logic model for the industry. This was used alongside academic literature on social impact assessments (SIAs) to define appropriate measures to interpret the industry’s success. This research led to the research question answered in this project, which is best summarised as: ‘How, and to what extent, do the activities of the meanwhile use industry create value in its users?” Analysis was then carried out using quantitative research methods on data collected from a questionnaire to examine the correlation between industry inputs and benefits delivered to the users. My results present an image of the meanwhile lease user landscape, and highlight trends within it. It was found that the meanwhile use industry does create value in its users by improving their ability to achieve their social impact objectives and, in particular, the novelty of a user’s offering and the frequency of their interactions with other 3Space users were positively correlated to the impact measurements

Research was carried out whilst working at 3Space - a UK charity that makes unused commercial property available to charities for free. As project manager of the Oxford unit, I helped run the pilot as part of a partnership with Barclays.
