title: Social Impact of Meanwhile Leases
---

Whilst at the University of Edinburgh I wrote a dissertation entitled 'Experiments in Creating Social Value: An exploration of 
the meanwhile use industry'. 3Space is a UK charity that makes unused commercial property available to charities for free. As 
project manager of the Oxford unit, I helped run the pilot as part of a partnership with Barclays. I simultaneously carried out a 
research project for my thesis on the social impact and scalability of meanwhile leases.
